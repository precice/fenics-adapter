# fenics-adapter
**experimental** preCICE-adapter for the open source computing platform FEniCS

_**Note:** This adapter is currently purely expermental and limited in functionality. If you are interested in using it or you want to contribute, feel free to contact us via the [preCICE mailing list](https://mailman.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/precice)._

**currently only supports 2D simulations in FEniCS**

This adapter was developed by [Benjamin Rüth](https://www5.in.tum.de/wiki/index.php/Benjamin_R%C3%BCth,_M.Sc._(hons)) during his research stay at Lund University in the group for [Numerical Analysis](http://www.maths.lu.se/english/research/research-divisions/numerical-analysis/) in close collaboration with [Peter Meisrimel](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lucat/user/09d80f0367a060bcf2a22d7c22e5e504).

## Installation

### Dependencies

Make sure to install 

* preCICE (https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki)
* python3 (this adapter supports **only python3**)
* the python language bindings for preCICE (https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/src/precice/bindings/python/README.md)
* fenics (https://fenicsproject.org/)
* and scipy (`pip3 install scipy`)

### Build and install the adapter

Run ``python3 setup.py install`` from your shell.

### Test the adapter

As a first test, try to import the adapter via `python3 -c "import fenicsadapter"`.

You can run the other tests via `python3 setup.py test`.

## Use the adapter

Add ``from fenicsadapter import Coupling`` in your FEniCS code. Please refer to the examples in the [tutorials repository](https://github.com/precice/tutorials) for usage examples.
